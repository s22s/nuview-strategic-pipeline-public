# Netlify Deployment Guide - NUVIEW Strategic Pipeline

## Overview

This guide provides complete instructions for deploying the NUVIEW Strategic Pipeline to Netlify with automated deployments from the main branch.

## Prerequisites

1. A Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)
2. GitHub repository access
3. Admin permissions on the repository

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Connect Repository to Netlify

1. **Log in to Netlify**: Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)

2. **Create New Site**:
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account if prompted

3. **Select Repository**:
   - Find and select `JacobThielNUVIEW/nuview-strategic-pipeline`
   - Click to configure

4. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: (leave empty - static site)
   - **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory)
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Step 2: Domain Configuration

The site is configured to use the Netlify subdomain:

**Primary Domain**: `salesnuviewspace.netlify.app`

This domain:
- Is automatically provisioned by Netlify
- Has HTTPS enabled via Netlify's SSL certificate
- Updates automatically on every push to main branch
- Requires no additional DNS configuration

**Alternative Access**: The site is also available via GitHub Pages at `jacobthielnuview.github.io/nuview-strategic-pipeline`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Go to Site Settings** → **Environment variables**
2. **Add the following variables**:
   - `NUVIEW_SCRAPE_TOKEN`: Your secure code for triggering scrapes
   - Any other secrets your workflows need

## Automated Deployments

### How It Works

1. **On Every Push to Main**:
   - Netlify automatically detects the push
   - Deploys the entire repository (static files)
   - Updates the live site within 30-60 seconds

2. **Deploy Previews**:
   - Pull requests automatically get preview URLs
   - Test changes before merging to main
   - Preview URLs are in the format: `deploy-preview-[pr-number]--your-site.netlify.app`

3. **Branch Deploys**:
   - Configure specific branches for automatic deployment
   - Useful for staging environments

### Deployment Triggers

The site will automatically deploy when:
- Code is pushed to the main branch
- Data files are updated (via daily scrape workflow)
- Manual deployment is triggered from Netlify dashboard

## Configuration Files

### netlify.toml

The `netlify.toml` file in the repository root configures:
- Build settings
- Redirect rules for clean URLs
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Cache control policies
- Asset optimization (minification, compression)

### _redirects

The `_redirects` file provides fallback redirect rules:
- Root redirects to dashboard
- Clean URL shortcuts for common pages
- Legacy URL redirects

## Integration with GitHub Actions

Your existing GitHub Actions workflows continue to work alongside Netlify:

### Daily Ops Workflow
- Scrapes data at 3 AM UTC
- Validates and pushes to main branch
- **Triggers automatic Netlify deployment**

### Backup Workflow
- Creates daily backups
- Pushes to repository
- Netlify ignores backup files (no redeploy needed)

### Deploy Pages Workflow (GitHub Pages)
- Can run in parallel with Netlify
- Useful for redundancy
- Or disable if only using Netlify

## Performance Optimizations

### Enabled by Default

1. **Asset Compression**:
   - Brotli and gzip compression for all text files
   - Automatic image optimization

2. **Caching**:
   - Static assets: 1 year cache
   - HTML files: revalidate on every request
   - Data JSON files: 5-minute cache with revalidation

3. **CDN**:
   - Global CDN for fast worldwide access
   - Edge caching reduces latency

4. **Security Headers**:
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - XSS Protection
   - Frame Options
   - HTTPS enforcement

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Netlify Analytics

1. **Go to Site** → **Analytics**
2. View:
   - Page views
   - Unique visitors
   - Top pages
   - Traffic sources
   - Bandwidth usage

### Deploy Notifications

Configure notifications for:
- Successful deployments
- Failed deployments
- Deploy previews ready

**Setup**:
1. Go to **Site Settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Deploy notifications**
2. Add notifications via:
   - Email
   - Slack
   - Webhook
   - GitHub commit status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Site Not Deploying

**Check**:
- Build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure main branch is being monitored
- Verify no build errors in logs

**Fix**:
- Trigger manual deploy from Netlify dashboard
- Check GitHub webhook is active

#### 2. 404 Errors

**Check**:
- Redirects in `netlify.toml` and `_redirects`
- Publish directory is set to `.` (root)

**Fix**:
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check redirect syntax

#### 3. Assets Not Loading

**Check**:
- Browser console for CSP errors
- Network tab for 404s
- Asset paths in HTML files

**Fix**:
- Update CSP in netlify.toml if needed
- Verify relative paths in HTML

#### 4. Custom Domain Not Working

**Check**:
- DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
- DNS records match Netlify requirements
- HTTPS provisioning status

**Fix**:
- Use `dig` or online DNS tools to verify
- Renew SSL certificate in Netlify if needed

## Manual Deployment

To deploy manually:

1. **Via Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Deploys**
   - Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

2. **Via Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify login
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Rollback

To rollback to a previous version:

1. Go to **Deploys** in Netlify dashboard
2. Find the deploy you want to restore
3. Click **...** → **Publish deploy**
4. Confirm the rollback

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Enable branch protection** on main branch
4. **Review deploy previews** before merging PRs
5. **Monitor deploy logs** for suspicious activity
6. **Regularly update dependencies** (though this is a static site)

## Cost Considerations

### Free Tier Includes:
- 100 GB bandwidth/month
- Unlimited sites
- HTTPS included
- Deploy previews
- Basic analytics

### Paid Tiers:
- Increased bandwidth (starting at $19/mo for 400 GB)
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration features
- Priority support

**Note**: For NUVIEW's use case, the free tier should be more than sufficient.

## Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review Netlify analytics
- [ ] Check deploy success rate
- [ ] Verify automated workflows still triggering deploys
- [ ] Review bandwidth usage

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Review and update security headers
- [ ] Test all redirect rules
- [ ] Verify custom domain SSL certificate
- [ ] Review performance metrics
